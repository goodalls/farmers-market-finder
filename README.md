* Farmers Market Finder

#### Project Pitch

  - I struggle finding a valid organic farmers market or CSA (Community Supported Agriculture). I would like to make an app that takes out the hassle of when and where Farmers markets are at and what products that they have. My app would be able to take a zip code and show you the closest farmers markets to your location. by clicking on the location you like it will show you the details of that farmers market.

#### MVP

  - Have a front page that accepts zip code search and shows second page with maps and detailed info about the market
  - unregistered user can favorite farmers markets and favorites persist on refresh 
  - When the market is clicked that each farmers market has a "show page" meaning each market page shows information pertaining to it. 
  - Well tested.
